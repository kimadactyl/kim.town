title: Non-representational Technology
---

I've been writing about and making technology for a long time and finally arrived at a central concept that anchors my thoughts: **Non-representational technology**.

Non-representational technology is a simple thing to experience but a tricky thing to explain. A [Community Technology Partnership](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1767173) is one way to create technology non-representationally. My studio Geeks for Social Change are currently working on exactly what this looks like through funding from [The National Lottery Community Fund](https://gfsc.studio/blog/2022/national-network-community-technology-partnerships/).

There’s so much to get in to and so much we’ve learnt and I’ve been stalled out on writing new things for over a year now. am therefore using [Alphabet Superset’s](https://www.alphabetsuperset.com/) 6 month writing challenge in an attempt to blow the dust off my writing, and will aim to complete one article a week on this (with a few break weeks) for each letter A-Z.

This work will therefore necessarily be kept messy, personal, and raw, and I invite feedback and (constructive) criticism either on the [GFSC discord](https://discord.com/invite/EwFHSp8h9h), [Mastodon](https://social.gfsc.studio/@kim) or email me at kim@gfsc.studio. This site will be improved as I go, and links make between articles. Hopefully at the end I have enough to put together a book outline! So let me know if you’re a publisher looking for cool new transfeminist views on technology too.
