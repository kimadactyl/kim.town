				I'm Kim Foale, a technologist, sound artist, and community organiser based in Manchester. I co-founded <a href="https://gfsc.studio">Geeks for Social Change</a>, a research studio that works with communities to create technology that addresses real needs rather than imposing solutions from above.
			</p>

			<p>
				My work sits at the intersection of technology and social justice. I believe that disadvantaged communities and their people are not the problem—they are the solution. Technology should support and amplify community power, not replace it or extract value from it.
			</p>

			<h2>Community Technology</h2>

			<p>
				Through GFSC, I've led projects including <a href="https://placecal.org">PlaceCal</a>, an award-winning community calendar system designed to combat loneliness and isolation; <a href="https://transdimension.uk">The Trans Dimension</a>, an online hub connecting trans communities across the UK; and <a href="https://github.com/geeksforsocialchange/imok">imok</a>, a safety bot supporting asylum seekers forced to report at hostile immigration centres.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've also worked with organisations including Gendered Intelligence, Trans Safety Network, The White Pube, and The Wildlife Trusts to build websites and tools that serve their communities rather than surveillance capitalism.
			</p>

			<h2>Sound & Perception</h2>

			<p>
				I hold a PhD from the University of Salford, where my research examined <a href="https://salford-repository.worktribe.com/output/1425397/a-listener-centered-approach-to-soundscape-analysis">soundscape through a listener-centred lens</a>. Rather than focusing on acoustic environments, I explored how factors like activity, expectation, control, and comfort shape how people actually experience sound in urban spaces.
			</p>

			<p>
				This interest in perception and listening has continued through sound art projects like <em>Elephants in the Dark</em>, an experiment exploring how our eyes can fool our ears and vice versa.
			</p>

			<h2>Writing & Research</h2>

			<p>
				I write about technology ethics, community organising, surveillance, and the ways tech culture fails the communities it claims to serve. My writing has appeared on the GFSC blog and in various publications and zines, including guides on inclusive events and reports on policing and technology.
