As founder-director of GFSC (a small community tech studio with about 5 employees), I've been running a Mastodon server since November 2022. We specifically use the Hometown fork of Mastodon.

## Advantages

Having a personal account on the work server eliminates confusion about whether to post professionally or personally. The platform generates genuine engagement, unlike Twitter, where algorithmic changes and polarized discourse discourage interaction. Content sharing works seamlessly without requiring login, functioning more like blog posts.

The early internet aesthetic appeals to many users. People just feel nicer on here, stuff feels kinder, and the environment lacks ads, influencers, and sponsored content, reducing cognitive overwhelm. Hosting your own server on your domain feels professional and maintains independence from corporate changes. The shared community space has transformed how staff conceptualize their work and community relationships in meaningful ways.

It's also really really nice to have a place for our community and staff to share a space. The platform facilitates meeting like-minded people rather than just maintaining existing networks, and the open-source nature means independence from corporate decisions and market pressures.

## Disadvantages

Self-hosting carries substantial costs, particularly when outsourcing support. Building an initial audience requires patience compared to mainstream platforms. Professional networking predominantly occurs on LinkedIn and Twitter, limiting opportunities on Mastodon.

The absence of algorithms means high-frequency posters receive disproportionate visibility, while carefully crafted posts don't gain traction. Viewing replies is a fucking nightmare, requiring navigation between servers and unnecessary steps. The system shows only partial replies; accessing all requires visiting the original server.

Finally, as a niche platform, the small user base means potential exploits remain untested. Security uncertainties regarding AI scraping and platform governance rely on community norms rather than structured safeguards.

## Recommendations

Whether to establish a Mastodon server depends heavily on organizational factors: technology independence importance, genuine interest in social media engagement, and capacity for experimental projects without immediate returns.

Organizations valuing tech independence and facing platform hostility should consider it. Those merely seeking message distribution or lacking tech focus should skip it. Groups must genuinely commit time rather than adding another obligation to staff.

Organizations should evaluate whether tech independence matters, whether they want expanded social presence, and whether they can sustain experimental projects. It works for our R&D-focused studio but may not suit brands or institutions without specific tech commitments.

I'm really happy with our decision and it's our most interactive channel alongside Instagram.
