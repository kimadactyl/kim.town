"The singularity" is a well-worn concept in sci-fi. Wikipedia introduces the concept as follows:

> "The **technological singularity**—or simply the **singularity**—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for human civilization."

This references classic AI takeover scenarios like HAL9000 and Skynet. However, I posit a different concern: an AI "exactly stupid enough it can happily take over the boring office jobs for the rest of time."

Office work is what Bret Victor calls the "small rectangle based knowledge economy"—converting information between documents and screens. This bureaucratic structure is foundational to modern society. Max Weber noted in 1921 that "A mature bureaucracy is an almost indestructible social structure."

David Graeber's *Bullshit Jobs* documents how many well-paid positions lack genuine utility. OpenAI's mission seeks systems that "outperform humans at most economically valuable work." But are they actually building machines for meaningless jobs?

AI isn't finding genuine use cases—COVID detection tools failed, ChatGPT applications are trivial workarounds for broken systems. We live in a "Polycrisis" where complex systems are collapsing.

Replacing individual broken system components with AI will perpetuate dysfunction rather than enable reform. As signal-to-noise ratios degrade through AI-generated content feeding AI systems, information credibility will collapse—not through superintelligent takeover, but through the degradation of already-failing bureaucratic systems.
