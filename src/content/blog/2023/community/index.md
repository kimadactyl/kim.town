"Community" is a concept at the heart of a lot of the work I've done over my life. For most people, happiness and identity assertion happen through community and family structures.

Communities take diverse forms: intentional (hobbies, sports), emergent (neighborhood-based), circumstantial (shared medical conditions), responsive to injustice (mutual aid), consumer-focused (conventions, collecting), identity-based (trans/PoC meetups), workplace-oriented (employee groups), or place-based (NHS workers, housing schemes).

Despite these differences, crucial questions often remain unexamined: who participates and why? How do people enter or exit? Where does power reside? What defines the boundaries?

A central aspect involves intentionality—choosing involvement with a group for non-monetary reasons. Yet complications arise when workplace community involvement becomes necessary for career advancement, or when people are categorized into communities they don't genuinely experience.

I describe a disconnect between external categorizations and lived experience. When filling forms, I'm lumped into the "LGBTQ community," though I identify more specifically as trans and "big-Q Queer." Others in the "BAME community" share similar disconnection. Currently, I feel alienated from any specific, tangible "LGBTQ" community offering genuine support, though friendships and groups exist.

This gap exists between real, affective, visceral day to day relations and external categorization—possibly the difference between "a community" (noun) and "being or feeling in community" (verb).

This reflects Goodhart's Law: community's recognized value makes it attractive to capitalism for workforce motivation, customer retention, and measuring "community-ness" against metrics while ignoring underlying purposes.

Fundamentally, community occupies the middle between the equally difficult ideas of "individuals" and "a society." I remain convinced community is vital but increasingly unwilling to leave the term unexamined, given how much depends on this virtual concept in very real and material ways.
