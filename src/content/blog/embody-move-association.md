This project involved redesigning a website for Embody Move Association, a practitioner training organization. The previous website was created five years earlier, and this remake incorporated new skills and approaches learned in the interim.

The organization teaches people who wish to become instructors for their techniques. At the time of the redesign, they were experiencing significant growth, so we built a website that is much more flexible and allows them to reuse the same content as much as possible.

## Key Challenges

The primary difficulty involved simplifying the relatively complex system of programs and courses while maintaining accessibility for both customers and administrators. The site functions as a prospectus through the "Our Programs" section but also offers alternative navigation methods: an A-Z course list and a date-based listing system.

We implemented a symbol based navigation to make it clear what everything is part of, since different modules fed into various programs. We accomplished this in Drupal while preserving ease of use for the client.

## Technical Details

The responsive design utilized a fluid grid system with Susy.
