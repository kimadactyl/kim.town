## Origins in Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhoods

The PlaceCal project emerged from Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhoods (MAFN), a resident-led initiative designed around "asset-based community development" principles. Rather than imposing top-down solutions, the partnership model enabled residents, organizations, and providers to collectively identify and address community needs.

A concrete example illustrates this approach: when residents in Hulme identified barriers to accessing health services, the partnership discovered that a church hall lacked accessible facilities. By coordinating funding and expertise across the NHS, the architecture school, and the church, they successfully built an accessible toilet—a relatively simple intervention that removed a significant obstacle to community wellness.

## The Problem: Hidden Community Activities

Research revealed a paradox: while older residents reported "there's nothing to do," extensive fieldwork uncovered a surplus of community activities. The actual problem was informational fragmentation. Events were scattered across Google Calendars, Facebook pages, flyers, and word-of-mouth networks—making them effectively invisible to those with limited social connections.

Maintaining centralized calendars proved unsustainable. Organizations discovered they were listing far more events than they'd initially reported, and the system created bottlenecks requiring constant staff intervention.

## A Different Approach to Technology

Rather than building another product-centered platform, the team designed PlaceCal around enabling existing practices. The core insight: organizations already use familiar tools like Google Calendar and Outlook, which generate machine-readable feeds. PlaceCal aggregates these iCal feeds, avoiding the need for staff to learn new systems.

This "capability-based" approach prioritizes education and distributed ownership. As noted, "education is not a prerequisite to political control—political control is the cause of popular education." The goal was developing neighborhood information infrastructure while building digital skills.

## Key Discoveries

Testing revealed that geographic proximity mattered far less than venue familiarity and organizational trust. Social capital significantly influenced how far people would travel for events.

The event typology also diverged sharply from existing platforms. Rather than ticketed one-off shows, the system needed to handle hundreds of recurring activities like coffee mornings, exercise classes, and craft sessions—typically organized by under-resourced groups lacking marketing budgets.

## The Launch

The project culminated in the Hulme Winter Lights Switch-On event in December 2017, where PlaceCal's first comprehensive community calendar was distributed as printed leaflets. The event itself demonstrated the platform's potential: by consolidating information from multiple agencies, organizers created what was "probably...the most comprehensive winter events listing Hulme has ever seen."
