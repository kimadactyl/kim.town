Once upon a time, Manchester saw itself as a leader in opposing nuclear weapons. However, the city now hosts numerous companies manufacturing or assisting in nuclear missile and submarine production—and these firms appear in regional marketing materials.

## The Arms Fair Connection

The Defense & Security Equipment International (DSEI) is one of the world's largest arms fairs, held biennially in London. It brings together thousands of arms dealers and buyers, including delegations from countries with documented human rights abuses. The UK government heavily subsidizes and promotes this event.

Approximately 60 companies based in Greater Manchester or with parent companies there exhibited at DSEI 2021, selling products ranging from "signage to literal nuclear missiles." These include Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, CACI, and Elbit Systems.

## Manchester's Nuclear Free Legacy

In 1980, Manchester declared itself a Nuclear Free City, positioning the region as a leader in the anti-nuclear weapons movement. City officials called upon the government to refrain from manufacturing or positioning nuclear weapons within city boundaries.

## The Reversal

Today's Greater Manchester Combined Authority actively promotes these arms companies as part of regional development initiatives. BAE Systems—whose aircraft have supported Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign in Yemen and which manufactures the Trident nuclear submarine fleet—appears prominently in GMCA's "Doing Digital Differently" brochure.

Additionally, arms companies sponsor educational programs teaching coding and cybersecurity to young people, obscuring the military applications of their work.
