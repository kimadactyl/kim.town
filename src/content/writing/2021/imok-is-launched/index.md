imok is a simple bot designed to support people undertaking potentially risky activities. It's primarily aimed at community groups working together to support these people.

The bot lets users 'check in' to the service with a messaging app or SMS message. If users don't 'check out' after 30 minutes (for example), it raises an alarm in a Telegram groupchat that project admins can join.

Example use cases are:

- Supporting protestors at risk of arrest or kidnapping
- Supporting women and LGBTQ+ people walking home at night, or going on dates
- Supporting journalists or medical staff in warzones
- Supporting people seeking asylum through 'signing in' processes

The tool was released under an open source MIT license and is available on GitHub with setup instructions and security recommendations.

## How did this come about?

GFSC was approached by No Borders Manchester to create a tool for their Signing Support Network. Under the UK government's 'hostile environment' policy, people seeking asylum must regularly sign in at designated centres. In Manchester, this occurs at Dallas Court Reporting Centre.

The reporting process has been described by asylum seekers as "the most dehumanising aspect of the whole asylum process." Reporting centres lack basic amenities and staff conduct questioning that may theoretically impact asylum cases. Frequency of check-ins ranges from daily to quarterly depending on assessed risk level.

The greatest concern is that individuals can be immediately detained and taken for deportation with no opportunity to contact family or legal representatives. Current support relies on volunteers maintaining constant on-the-ground presence, which is labor-intensive and unsustainable.

## What's Next

After completing the Dallas Court pilot, the team plans to adapt the tool to support UK protest movements, addressing police tactics of arresting and relocating protesters away from home.
