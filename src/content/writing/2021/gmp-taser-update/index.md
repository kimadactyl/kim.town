Despite claims of declining Taser usage, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have actually increased their deployment of the weapon to record levels. The organization reported inflated statistics to community groups while providing different figures to the Home Office. According to official data, "Tasers were used at more than double the rate claimed in these infographics for the same April 2019 - March 2020 period."

Key concerns identified include:
- Racial disparities have widened, with Black residents experiencing Taser use at more than five times the rate of white residents
- Usage against children increased from 118 to 132 incidents
- GMP plans to double the number of Taser-trained officers despite these findings

## Background

Since Tasers were introduced to UK policing in 2003, eighteen people have died following their use. Between April 2017 and March 2019, GMP saw a 73% increase in total Taser incidents. The weapon has been used against vulnerable populations including children, individuals with mental health conditions, and those with disabilities.

## New Findings

Home Office data for April 2019 to March 2020 shows GMP Taser usage increased 7% to 1,543 incidents—the force's highest level ever. Nationally, Taser incidents rose 36.7% to 32,057 cases across England and Wales.

Of GMP's incidents, Black residents represented 11.8% despite comprising a smaller portion of the population, indicating significant disproportionality. Additionally, 132 incidents involved children under eighteen, with eleven involving children under eleven.

## Ongoing Concerns

GMP's public reporting methods obscure actual Taser deployment figures compared to Home Office methodology. Recent investigations by the Independent Office for Police Conduct examine specific cases involving controversial Taser use.

Resistance Lab calls for an immediate halt to expanding Taser-trained officers and supports a complete ban on using Tasers against children and individuals under mental health detention.
