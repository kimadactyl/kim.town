Geeks for Social Change has launched **The Trans Dimension**, an online community hub connecting trans communities across the UK by aggregating news, events, and services by and for trans people in one accessible location.

## Partnership & Funding

The initiative was developed collaboratively with Gendered Intelligence, a trans-led national charity. The Comic Relief Tech for Good "Build" fund supported the project, which expands on GFSC's existing PlaceCal work. The pilot focuses on London before a planned UK-wide expansion.

## The Problem

Trans, non-binary, and gender-diverse individuals face significant challenges:

- Higher rates of social isolation and loneliness
- Greater exposure to discrimination and violence
- Worse health and mental health outcomes
- Reduced educational and employment opportunities

The barriers to community connection are substantial. Currently, finding trans-friendly events requires checking multiple websites separately, and vetting each opportunity for safety. Facebook presents risks of accidental outing. For disabled trans people, accessibility information gaps compound these difficulties.

## The Solution

The Trans Dimension creates a community-owned system where providers centrally contribute listings. This approach ensures relevant, up-to-date information while giving smaller groups equal visibility. A dedicated staff member at Gendered Intelligence moderates listings.

The platform aims to reduce isolation, build collective resilience, and create a supportive network where trans people of all ages and abilities can safely access community resources.
