## How Karrot Came to Be

Karrot emerged from a vision to create a digital sharing platform, building on the success of a food-sharing initiative in German-speaking regions. The project began with an invitation to an event a decade ago. Initial gatherings across Europe led to the development of Karrot as a tool for groups unable to use existing platforms due to language or governance constraints.

## Core Functionality

Karrot functions as a community organizing tool where users create groups, accept members, and coordinate in-person activities. The platform tracks activity feedback and generates statistics over time. Communication features allow targeted messaging to specific group members or activity participants.

The platform emphasizes "less-hierarchical structures" without traditional admin roles, instead incorporating group processes for conflict resolution and community agreements.

## Notable Achievements

Approximately 3 tonnes of food are redistributed daily through Karrot. The project has maintained operations for a decade with minimal funding, primarily through volunteer contributions. The team exclusively uses open-source tools for project management and infrastructure.

## Technology Stack

Karrot uses Python with Django and Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL with Redis, and Vue with Quasar for the frontend. The team manages deployments through Ansible and supports self-hosting via Co-op Cloud or Docker Compose.

## Getting Involved

Users can join the Playground group, create their own community, or connect via the community forum and Codeberg repository. The distributed team spans five European countries.

## Future Direction

The team plans to support existing groups better, reach new communities, and develop features enabling interaction with broader audiences beyond core members, including public event listings and improved governance support mechanisms.
