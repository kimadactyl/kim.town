Five years into their mission, Geeks for Social Change (GFSC) has continued their work supporting community groups in leveraging technology effectively. The organization reflects on a year characterized by growth, collaboration, and deepened commitment to their core vision.

## Year in Numbers

The team mobilized significant volunteer effort throughout 2025:

- **23 volunteers** contributed across various initiatives, from code development to community management
- **33 articles** appeared on their new community blog, featuring "8 new voices"
- **3 livestreams** covered topics including sticker-making, PlaceCal, and Mapped
- Expanded social media presence across six platforms
- Multiple speaking engagements at academic and advocacy conferences

## New Contributors and Voices

GFSC deliberately recruited writers who doubted their expertise. New authors included developers, teachers, comedians, creators, streamers, video artists, and zinesters—each bringing distinct perspectives on technology's role in community life.

## Core Vision

The organization crystallized its mission as: "working with community groups to make technology that produces community." They define community as "people you don't get paid to hang out with."

## 2025 Focus Areas

Articles addressed corporate technology's harms, alternatives to billionaire-owned platforms, practical guides for personal websites and community technology partnerships, and explorations of accessibility in design.

The organization emphasized collaborative action and invited community input for 2026 priorities while requesting support through donations.
