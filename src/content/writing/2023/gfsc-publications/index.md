Geeks for Social Change has expanded significantly from a single-person operation in 2020 to a team of 11 staff across two organizations. The organization is shifting its communications approach, moving away from traditional social media toward more ethical platforms.

## New Publications Available

The studio is introducing several physical and digital publications:

**The Trans Dimension Guide to Inclusive Events** — A collaborative zine created with Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People and Gendered Intelligence. It provides practical guidance on making events accessible for trans and disabled participants, including prompts for comprehensive accessibility statements. The guide is available for purchase, free download, or as plain text.

**Trans Dimension Badges** — Limited-stock enamel pins from the Trans Dimension project launch, with proceeds supporting the project.

**UnTechCon 1 Documentation Zine** — Created by artist honor ash, this zine documents discussions from the inaugural UnTechCon event about envisioning anti-capitalist technology futures.

**"A Growing Threat to Life: Taser Usage by Greater Manchester Police"** — A 2020 collaborative report combining abolitionist organizing with data science research. Originally gaining significant media coverage, the publication is now freely available.

**Academic Paper** — A scholarly article exploring how capability-centered technology approaches can strengthen community participation, featuring PlaceCal's implementation and potential.

**Podcast Archive** — A newly organized hub displaying all podcast episodes and transcripts in one location.

All publications are distributed through Pen Fight, an independent Manchester-based feminist and queer bookshop.
