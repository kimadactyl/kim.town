[Goodhart’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) states that "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”. This is a really common method used to make any manner of social and technical phenomena countable, which eventually inevitably has the effect of allowing it to be institutionalised.

[[BMI]] is an example of this, as is the box-ticking done when quantifying [[Community]].
