## Executive Summary

Human rights and medical experts have raised concerns about Taser health risks, including potential cardiac complications leading to death. Since 2003, at least 18 people have died after police discharged Tasers in England and Wales, with inquests identifying Taser use as a cause or contributing factor in at least three deaths.

Police Taser usage across England and Wales increased over 500% in the past decade—from 3,573 incidents in 2009/10 to 23,451 in 2018/19. Greater Manchester Police's usage surged 73% year-over-year (832 to 1,442 incidents), exceeding the national average of 39%.

Key findings for GMP in 2018/19:

- Reported more Taser incidents than any force except Metropolitan Police
- Black people experienced Taser deployment at nearly 4 times the rate of white people
- Reported 118 incidents involving children under 18—more than any force except Met Police
- Documented 8 incidents involving children under 11 years old
- 210 cases (15% of total) involved individuals perceived to have physical or mental disabilities

## Background: Police Tasers in England and Wales

Conducted Energy Devices (Tasers) deliver 50,000 volts of electricity through needle-tipped darts up to 21 feet away. Introduced in 2003 as a "less lethal" alternative to firearms, they were initially limited to specialist firearms officers but rolled out to all 43 forces by 2013.

The Home Office has accelerated Taser adoption. In 2019, Northamptonshire became the first force arming all frontline officers. By March 2020, Home Secretary Priti Patel announced £6.7 million for 8,155 additional devices.

### Health and Safety Concerns

Medical and human rights experts highlight serious risks. In the United States, Reuters documented 1,005 deaths following police Taser use since the early 2000s; in 153 cases (over one-fifth), Tasers contributed to death.

In the UK, Amnesty International reports 18 deaths after police Taser discharge since 2003. Coroners' inquests identified Taser use as a cause or contributing factor in deaths of Marc Cole, Jordan Begley, and Andrew Pimlott.

The Taser X26 model—standard issue for all 43 English and Welsh forces until 2018—generated particular concern. This device delivered up to 135 microcoulombs per pulse. The United Nations Committee Against Torture raised alarm; Taser International halted X26 sales in the US and Canada in 2014, moving to lower-powered alternatives. However, forces continue using both models.

### Enhanced Risks for Vulnerable Groups

Children and vulnerable adults face heightened danger. Between April 2018 and March 2019, 1,700 Taser incidents involved children under 18 in England and Wales—a 78% increase from the previous year. Data suggests 29 incidents involved children under 11. The Children's Rights Alliance for England reports Black children are disproportionately Tasered; Metropolitan Police data showed Black children constituted 54% of child Taser incidents in 2017/18.

Two-thirds of people Tasered by police between 2010 and 2014 were identified as having mental health conditions. In secure psychiatric facilities' first year of reporting (2017), patients experienced Taser discharge, aiming, or drawing on at least 96 occasions.

### Racial Disparities

The Guardian's analysis of Home Office data (April 2018–March 2019) found Black people experienced Taser use at almost 8 times the rate of white people across England and Wales. This disparity prompted human rights organizations—Liberty, Inquest, StopWatch, and The Open Society—to resign from the National Taser Stakeholder Advisory Group in March 2020, citing the body's failure to address racial inequities and police refusal to regulate Taser use through policy.

### "Policing by Consent" Concerns

The expanding Taser use raises broader concerns about police legitimacy. While police are drawing weapons more frequently, discharge rates have declined—from approximately 1 in 5 incidents (2011–2015) to 1 in 8 (subsequent years). This suggests increasing use for intimidation rather than necessity.

A 2018 Cambridge University study in partnership with City of London Police found officers carrying Tasers were more likely to be assaulted than unarmed officers. Researchers identified the "weapons effect": sight of a weapon increases aggressive behavior. Officers carrying Tasers used force 48% more often than unarmed counterparts.

## Greater Manchester Police: The Numbers

GMP's 2018/19 Taser usage raised multiple concerns:

**Frequency**: GMP reported 1,442 incidents—second only to Metropolitan Police's 7,396.

**Growth**: Usage increased 73% from 832 incidents in 2017/18 to 1,442 in 2018/19, following GMP's June 2017 decision to double trained officers to 1,100.

**Discharge Rate**: GMP discharged Tasers in approximately 1 in 6 incidents—higher than the national average of 1 in 8.

**Racial Disparities**: Of 1,442 incidents, 142 involved Black individuals (10%) despite representing approximately 2.5% of Greater Manchester's population. Black people experienced deployment at nearly 4 times the white rate.

**Children**: GMP reported 118 incidents involving children under 18—second only to Metropolitan Police. Concerningly, GMP was responsible for 8 of the 29 national incidents involving children under 11.

**Disabilities**: 210 cases (15%) involved individuals perceived by officers as having physical or mental disabilities.

## Case Studies: The Human Impact

### Howard Swarray (2009)

Forty-one-year-old Howard Swarray, an epileptic man, suffered a seizure at a Manchester gym on November 23, 2009. During the postictal state—when individuals experience disorientation and confusion—paramedics called police for assistance. Upon arrival, officers physically restrained Swarray before one fired a Taser twice, including once in "drive-stun" mode.

Swarray developed renal failure from the exertion and muscle contractions. He spent eight days in an induced coma and subsequently suffered panic attacks and depression.

### Jordan Begley (2013)

Twenty-three-year-old Jordan Begley died on July 10, 2013, after GMP officers Tasered him at his Gorton home. His mother had called 999 when a neighbor accused Jordan of stealing a handbag. Police arrived to find an unarmed, calm young man. During questioning, PC Terence Donnelly fired a Taser for nine seconds—nearly double the recommended limit—before officers struck and restrained him. Jordan suffered cardiac arrest and died at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

A June 2015 inquest ruled Jordan had been "inappropriately and unreasonably" Tasered. The jury delivered an unprecedented narrative verdict, concluding that "stressor factors" including the Taser use "more than materially contributed" to his death.

### Michael Gilchrist (2014)

Fifty-three-year-old Michael Gilchrist, who had bipolar disorder and autism, suffered a mental health episode on June 6, 2014, in Wythenshawe. After breaking windows and bleeding from his injuries, a concerned neighbor called police.

GMP officers arrived and within two minutes deployed CS gas and fired a Taser twice—a flammable combination discouraged by guidelines. PC Samuel Schofield then delivered eight additional shocks lasting 72 seconds total. Michael was left catatonic.

In May 2019, High Court Justice O'Farrell ruled in the family's favor, finding PC Schofield used "unnecessary, unreasonable and inappropriate" force.

## Conclusion

These three cases illustrate that Tasers pose intrinsic threats to life, particularly for Black communities and those with mental health conditions. Each victim's family contacted police because their relative needed help during medical or emotional distress. Officers escalated situations with lethal consequences within minutes or seconds.

**Resistance Lab's demand is clear: the abolition of Tasers.**
