In their collaborative practice, Geeks for Social Change has identified two distinct working approaches: the craftsperson's creative focus and the scientist's rigorous methodology.

## The Craftsperson's Approach

Craftspeople leverage experience to make decisions based on personal judgment rather than external data. Small teams of one to two craftspeople can deliver a small-to-medium sized project (like a simple website or a set of print assets) relatively quickly and to a high quality. However, this approach risks embedding unstated assumptions about audiences and creates knowledge silos that make handoffs difficult for team members who weren't involved from the start.

## The Scientist's Approach

Scientists prioritize evidence gathering through user testing and stakeholder feedback. They embrace iteration and evolving requirements throughout a project. While this produces more holistically considered outcomes, projects take longer and risk becoming bland through committee-based decision-making, potentially causing consultation fatigue.

## Finding Balance

The organization recommends five strategies:

1. **Clarify decision-making authority** upfront
2. **Define what's fixed versus changeable** through sign-off stages
3. **Set time boundaries** on project elements
4. **Outline expectations and assumptions** before work begins
5. **Explain the reasoning** behind user-centered feedback requirements

Rather than viewing these approaches as opposing camps, GFSC suggests emphasizing context-dependent flexibility while recognizing that both contribute essential value to research, design, and development.
