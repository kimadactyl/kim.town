Geeks for Social Change has launched its inaugural podcast episode, "How government technology limits who we can become," featuring discussions on surveillance, state control, and activism with guests Mallory Moore (Trans Safety Network), Zara Manoehoetoe (youth worker and community organizer), and Dr Kim Foale.

## Defining Activism

We explore why many reject the "activist" label, despite engaging in grassroots work. Zara notes that the term gets weaponized to delegitimize community voices, particularly when challenging institutional power. Rather than identifying as activists, participants prefer describing themselves as involved in "organising" and community care work.

## Technology as a System of Control

A central concept discussed is the distinction between "holistic" and "prescriptive" technologies. Holistic technologies (like pottery or non-networked computers) give users control over their work. Prescriptive technologies enable bosses and authorities to monitor and control workers. Modern platforms appear useful while actually serving surveillance functions.

As Mallory states: "The whole thing belongs to someone else" because ownership determines who controls access and transparency.

## The Manchester Gang Case

The episode examines a shocking 2020 case where ten Black teenagers faced conspiracy charges based primarily on a Telegram group chat discussing a friend's death. Evidence included drill music videos and phone data, none proving direct involvement in violent acts.

Zara emphasizes: "What you hold in your phone…that is who you truly are as a person" according to the prosecution's logic, a troubling inversion where digital representation supersedes actual character and involvement.

## Intersecting Oppressions

Parallels emerge between criminalization of Black youth through tech surveillance and institutional barriers facing trans people through legal gender registration systems. Both exemplify how technology encodes state control and limits who people can become.

Zara concludes that recognizing these connections across struggles is essential: "My fight is your fight, your fight is my fight" through shared knowledge and intersectional organizing.
