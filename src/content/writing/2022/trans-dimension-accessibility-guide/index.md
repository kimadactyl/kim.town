Geeks for Social Change, in partnership with Gendered Intelligence and the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People, has created a zine focused on making events more accessible for trans communities and everyone else.

The resource emerged from workshops with staff, young people, and disabled advocates. When we asked participants about positive event experiences, they heard: "The best I've had is mediocre." We frame this not as a failure of intention but rather a gap in practical guidance and support materials.

The zine is presented as collaborative work grounded in the principle that there is no universal solution to accessibility questions. Instead, it offers practical frameworks developed through community input.

The guide is available as a free download, though we suggest a £3 donation if supporters are able to contribute. The document remains in draft form and welcomes feedback. Readers can submit comments to either GFSC or Gendered Intelligence via email.

The initiative reflects a commitment to creating resources that support trans liberation and disabled liberation alongside event accessibility improvements.
