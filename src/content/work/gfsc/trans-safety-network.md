Trans Safety Network are old friends of Geeks For Social Change, and we've always been passionate supporters of the tireless, often painful work their team do to unpick both mainstream media and far right lies about the trans community. They approached us for a rebrand, and to redesign their website to make it more authoritative and robust.

We worked with them to understand their key audiences and build a new brand which focused on elevating their site's clarity and trustworthiness. Trans Safety Network is a leading source for reputable, high quality research on hatred against trans people in the UK, and their site needed to reflect that position.

Something really vital to this project was a sense of _demystifying_. We wanted to make sure that anyone who approached the site would be able to understand it, and that nothing relied too heavily on assumed prior knowledge. This informed the web design process and made sure that access to information was prioritised throughout. We worked with frequent collaborator, [Squid](https://studiosquid.co.uk/), on the branding and visual identity of this project.
