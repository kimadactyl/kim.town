GFSC Community is a not-for-profit infrastructure organisation that enables people to create ethical, meaningful, creative and socially valuable technology and design. It addresses a gap where many individuals lack access to capital, social networks, project mentoring, and job opportunities to sustain left-tech projects.

The community blog launched in March 2025, emphasising "the doing, recognising that the left is very critique-focussed." The focus is on creating post-billionaire technology: infrastructure owned and operated by communities themselves.

## Mission

GFSC aims to create a culture where communities own and operate their own community technology as a normal part of community life. The organisation seeks to make tech billionaires obsolete by developing community-controlled means of digital production.

## Key Problems Addressed

- Corporate platforms designed to divide attention and extract value from communities
- Dominance of speculative startup culture funded by venture capital
- Lack of sustainable funding models for community-owned tech alternatives
- Technology methodologies adapted for profit rather than community benefit

## What We Do

- **Community Spaces**: Managed Discord servers and email lists serving as entry points for members
- **Events**: Regular gatherings highlighting materialist left-wing and anarchist perspectives
- **Project Support**: Connects community projects with volunteer networks, funding, and visibility
- **Collective Investment**: Facilitates collaborative capital attraction for ambitious initiatives

## Network Partners

GFSC collaborates with tech co-ops (Common Knowledge, Autonomic), open-source projects (Mastodon, Karrot), and community-focused studios creating tools like PlaceCal (event aggregation), Mapped (membership visualisation), and Resilience Web (local resource mapping).

## First Year

In its first year, GFSC Community engaged 23 volunteers across various projects, published 33 articles featuring 8 new voices, hosted 3 livestreamed events, and conducted community spotlight interviews with organisations like Karrot, Mastodon, and Resilience Web.
