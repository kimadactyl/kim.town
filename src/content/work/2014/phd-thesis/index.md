This thesis reexamines soundscape through a listener-focused lens rather than emphasizing environmental characteristics. The research employs qualitative methodology, particularly Grounded Theory, to critique existing approaches that prioritize acoustic environments over individual perceptions.

## Key Findings

The study proposes an analytical framework that enhances understanding of auditory perceptions, leading to richer soundscape evaluations in urban contexts. Key findings reveal that several factors significantly influence how people experience acoustic environments:

- Activity
- Expectation
- Control
- Comfort
- Sensitivity
- Search

Listeners frequently employ coping mechanisms like music to modify their sonic experiences.

## Methodology

The research uses Grounded Theory as its primary qualitative methodology, allowing for the development of theory directly from data gathered through participant observations and interviews about listening experiences in urban environments.
